This application is just a small multiplayer game where users take turn drawing on a blank canvas and guessing what was drawn. 

It was also supposed to have an authorization and authentication system but strange bugs prevented this. 

This application requires all the dependencies specified in package.json to work on your own node server. It was created on a windows machine but I see no reason why it wouldn't work on other systems compatible with node. 

The application can also be seen running from https://finalproject-qizdwoncfe.now.sh/game.html
